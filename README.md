# dadi_tutorial

Disclaimer: this repo contains a tutorial for dadi as I understand how to run it. There is no guarantee that what I am describing here is accurate. For how to use dadi, please see the manual from the dadi's website: https://bitbucket.org/gutenkunstlab/dadi. This tutorial is purely for the purpose of documenting what I am learning in terms of learning dadi and that maybe useful for someone else who just started out learning how to use dadi.
